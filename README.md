# Refactor VBA code and measure performance for Stock Analysis

## ***Overview of Project***

### **Purpose**
<!The purpose and background are well defined (2 pt).ยก>
Deliver Steve a brief analysis to compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, with a workbook that will help him obtain consolidated and structured information on the data of the stocks in relation to the selected year. As well that the workbook will help him expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years with an improved 'macro' that will take a short time to execute.

## ***Results: Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.***
<!The analysis is well described with screenshots and code (4 pt).ยก>

### **Compare the stock performance**

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>All Stocks (2017)</td>
        <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
        <td>All Stocks (2018)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="Resources/VBA_Challenge_2017.png" width=350 height=350></td>
        <td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
        <td><img src="Resources/VBA_Challenge_2018.png" width=350 height=350></td>
    </tr>
 </table>
 <tr>

    As we can observe the performance of both years are quite different, there's no similarity between both results neither in "Total Daily Volume", non "Rerturn".

    It would be of great help to have at least one more year to have a three year comparation, but here is what we can infer:
        - In 2017, for almost all companies ("Tickers") was a good year in terms of "Return". Only one company, TERP, had a negative return.
        - In 2018, 83.33% of the compared companies have red numbers in terms of returns, we can even speculate that it was the worst year for stocks since the financial crisis.
        - Finally, as a small tendency we can observe that ENPH and RUN had a positve return, and TERP had a negative return in both years; the three had a higher "Total Daily Volume" in 2018 vs. 2017.
